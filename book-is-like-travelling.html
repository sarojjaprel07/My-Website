    <h1>Book is Like Travelling</h1>
    <p>Reading a book is like traveling without leaving your seat. Just as traveling takes you to new places, meeting new people and experiencing different cultures, a book takes you on a journey through its stories, ideas, and knowledge. When you open a book, you step into a new world, whether it is a distant land, a different time, or even a unique perspective.</p>
    <p>Through books, you can explore mountains, oceans, cities, and even outer space. You can experience adventures, mysteries, and histories that you might never encounter in real life. Each page is like a step forward in your journey, revealing new sights and feelings.</p>
    <p>Traveling broadens your mind, and so does reading. It opens your imagination and helps you understand others better. Books give you the freedom to roam anywhere, anytime. Unlike physical travel, they don’t require money or time to pack — only curiosity and an open heart.</p>
    <p>In this way, books are magical portals to countless journeys. They let you travel far and wide, without ever moving your feet.</p>
